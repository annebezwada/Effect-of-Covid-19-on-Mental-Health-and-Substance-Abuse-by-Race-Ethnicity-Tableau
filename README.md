# Effect-of-Covid-19-on-Mental-Health-and-Substance-Abuse-by-Race-Ethnicity-Tableau

During my time at Nvolve as a data visualization intern, I created my first dashboard using Tableau! Over 3 months, I created this dashboard. This dashboard explores the relationship between Covid-19 cases and mental health illnesses and substance abuse in Maryland. I was able to conclude that African Americans made up majority of cases as well as they experienced the biggest increase of deaths due to mental health illness and drug overdoses during 2020. Check it out below! üëáüèΩ
